## Description

The cells can "evolve" through mutations, which occur at a 30% rate in this version.
I added a simple perceptron model to determine cell replication behaviour. The model has three inputs: age, health, and the nutrient levels beneath the cell.

This project taught me much about Raylib and C++; Iâ€™m ready to move on.

Some ideas I'd like to implement if I have time:
- All cell behaviour goes from the brain, nothing is hardcoded
- Parallel on multiple cores or even GPU to enable bigger simulations
- Add more environmental factors like sun, water, temperature
- Add more views to gather more data. Add charts with population rates etc
- Add brushes to draw on the environment
- Add multiplayer where users grow their species and then clash them


## Build and run

Was tested on MacOS

```sh
cd build
cmake .. # builds using cmake with specs from CMakeLists.txt and puts the output in build folder
make # compiles code
./artificial-life
```
